<p>Dear Mr./Ms. LastName,  
</p>
<p>I read about Company X's retail management training program in College Graduate Magazine and 
I would like to inquire about the possibility of openings.  
</p>
<p>I am interested in a career in retail management and am planning to relocate to the New York 
City area in the near future. I would be interested in learning more about the company and about 
available opportunities.  
</p>
<p>I have a Bachelor of Science degree in Management and Business, as well as retail experience as 
a Sales Associate and Key Holder. In addition, I completed two internships focusing on retail 
management.  
</p>
<p>My resume, which is enclosed, contains additional information on my experience and skills. I 
would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the training program with you and to provide further 
information on my candidacy. I can be reached anytime via my cell phone, 555-555-5555.  
</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this 
exciting opportunity.

<p>Dear Mr./Ms.: 
</p>
<p>Union Carbide's extensive list of products and wide range of sales offices are attractive to me as I 
seek a position in the area of technical sales. My background encompasses both technical and 
sales abilities. 
</p>
<p>You will notice in my resume that I worked as a summer intern for the city of Philadelphia and 
assisted a city engineer in the field of wastewater treatment. The UNOX System that you have 
developed is a method with which I am familiar, both from an experiential and a research 
capacity. In my summer job, the process we used involved utilizing oxygen gas in the wastewater 
treatment process. For various course projects, I had the opportunity to conduct in-depth 
research on a filtering process that supports wastewater treatment. 
</p>
<p>As a supplement to my technical skills, I have developed capabilities in the field of sales. My 
position with the ACME Sales Company netted a $20,000 profit this past summer and the honor 
of being named Number 1 Salesperson in Cuyahoga County, Ohio. In addition, I was privileged to 
be the co-author, with my marketing professor, of an article entitled "The Art of The Sales Deal." 
This combination of practical and research experiences can be applied to the distribution of the 
growing number of consumer products of Union Carbide. 
</p>
<p>I would welcome the opportunity to review my qualifications and background in greater detail 
and will call you next week about the possibility of such a meeting. I plan on being in South 
Charleston the week of (date) and hope we can arrange a meeting at your convenience during 
this period. 
</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention. 
</p>
<p>Sincerely, 
(Handwritten sig.)
